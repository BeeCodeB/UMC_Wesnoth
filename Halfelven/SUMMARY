Descriptive Summary: Halfelven

    The halfelven are an ancient, set-aside faction from the south side of the Black River. Their home is an Arcadian land of hills, meadows, shores, ashlar ramparts, incredible metalwork and artifacts. Lacking in combat prowess, halfelven units of the National Defense Forces are relatively cheap and fairly weak, but poised to survive in the competitive roster. They generally rise quickly because of their IQ and sophistication. They use tamed phoenixes like scouting birds and protective robots like golems.
    
    They have Marine Corps units around leaders and tactically use terrain features to prevail in battles. Each member of the Marine Corps wears a blue-green ring of cephyr. The cyan color of the ring of cephyr matches the color of the blue-green eyes of all halfelven. This ring is a reminder to every marine that their actions should be ethical, they should be like shields and not swords of vengeance, destruction or conquest.
    The steadfast Guardian units are trained to repel the nemesis of necromancy, the walking dead, and dark magic. Members of the Guardian Corps wear a holy silver ring of adamantine. Its power lies in protection and concealment from evil.
    Agile units of the Maiden Corps, many of them mothers, defend the homeland and protect their children, the old and the weak. As national teachers and professors, they are versed in science, medicine, ethics and law. Now, every member of the Maiden Corps wears a ruby ​​ring said to 'rekindle hearts in a world that grows chill'!
    These rings do not confer any magical powers. They are artificially crafted objects of secrecy, and defense.
