"+_"The<bold>text=Halfelven Default</bold> era features ♙lvl1 recruits and ♕lvl2 leaders.
"+_"<bold><ref>text='Halfelven' dst='..race_halfelven'</ref></bold> are a unique faction from the south-western parts of the Great Continent (Irdya), beyond the Black River. Among them are paramedics, slingers, spearmen and -women, male and female leaders, phoenix scouting birds, and protective golems. Halfelven units are relatively cheap and rather weak but ready to survive in competitive selection. They generally level up quickly due to their superior intelligence and sophistication. They feature liminal units that coordinate attacks at dawn or dusk around leaders and tactically use terrain fatures to prevail in fights."
